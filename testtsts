### España Circo Este: A Journey through their Catalogue


***
My Corpus aim is to analyze the catalougue of Italian band España Circo Este, a band that I actually work with as a stage-tech and light-engineer.
I'll try to focus on the distinction between their first two studio albums with the latest two, since there was an important shifting between a heavier and raw sound to a much more pop-indie approach to the production, and how this changed the band performances and compositions.
